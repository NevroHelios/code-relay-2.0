GreenToken is a revolutionary web3 platform that incentivizes students to participate in eco-friendly activities through blockchain-based rewards. By combining sustainability with decentralized technology, we're creating a transparent and engaging way to promote environmental consciousness on campus.

## 🔑 Key Features

### 🗑️ Verifiable Eco-Actions
- QR codes on dustbins for tracking participation
- Geo-coordinate verification to prevent fraud
- Photo/video submission for activity validation

### 🏆 Immutable Reward System
- NFT-based Green Tokens as rewards
- Transparent and fair distribution
- Blockchain-secured achievement records

### 💰 Utility & Benefits
- DeFi capabilities for token holders
- Campus discounts and privileges
- Priority access to facilities (labs, libraries)

## 🔄 How It Works

1. Students participate in eco-friendly activities (e.g., garbage collection)
2. They scan QR codes at designated locations
3. Our system verifies the action through location data and photo/video evidence
4. Smart contracts automatically mint and distribute Green Tokens
5. Students can use tokens for various benefits or hold as investment

## 🚀 Scalability Plan

### Phase 1: Institution Level
- Pilot program within our campus
- Build initial user base and refine system

### Phase 2: Community Expansion
